## How to add it to your site

This script requires jQuery so make sure you have it loaded on your page.

Add the stylesheet in the `<head>` of your page:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/selection-sharer.css" />
    
and add the Javascript at the bottom of your page near the closing `</body>` tag:

    <script src="dist/selection-sharer.js"></script>
    <script>
    $('p').selectionSharer();
	</script>

If you want to add Facebook share, please make sure that your page has a Facebook App ID meta tag:
    
    <meta property="fb:app_id" content="123456789" />

The url shared can be set using the og:url tag:

    <meta property="og:url" content="http://your.url/to/share" />

The url shared via twitter can be set using a link tag with the "shortlink" rel attribute -- see http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-shortlink for more information:

    <link rel="shortlink" href="http://bit.ly/1VV1wxD" />

Or if you are using [requirejs](http://requirejs.org), you can do:


    require(["dist/selection-sharer"], function(SelectionSharer) {
      var sharer = new SelectionSharer();
      selectionSharer.setElements('p'); // bind mouseup event to all <p> elements
    });

Or more simply:

    require(["dist/selection-sharer!"]);


That's it. 

Please let me know if you install this script on your site. Just star this repo and ping me on Twitter [@xdamman](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=%40xdamman%20Thanks%20for%20http%3A%2F%2Fxdamman.github.io%2Fselection-sharer%20-%20It%20looks%20great%20on%20my%20site:%20). Thank you!

### Notes 

- Images are included inline in the CSS as SVG (perfect for Retina displays, loading time and to easily create new color schemes)
- Total size gzipped minified: 3.5K (equally split between css and javascript)
- This branch differs from xdamman's upstream branch by slightly modifying the way the Facebook link sharer is called. In particular, it now modifies the "description" property instead of the "caption" property, and populates values for the page using schema.org and microformats.org microformat data.

## Demos

There is a `demos/` directory with some examples using `jquery`, `requirejs` or simple javascript. 

You can also try it directly on my blog on http://xdamman.com.


## Bookmarklet version

Add a new bookmark to your bookmark bar, edit its url and copy paste the following code:

    javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.src="//xdamman.github.io/selection-sharer/lib/selection-sharer/dist/bookmarklet.js";document.body.appendChild(s);})()


## Building

To recompile the minified versions of the css and javascript in the `dist/` directory, simply run:

    npm install
 

## Contribute

This is still early days so there is still a lot to do and I welcome contributions. 

TODO:

- Make a browser extension
- Make a Wordpress plugin - done by @jcvangent http://wordpress.org/plugins/selection-sharer/ 
- Add support for different themes
- Add tests
- Tests across multiple browsers (currently only tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox on a Mac)
- Remove dependency on jQuery
- Make the CSS more robust against collisions
